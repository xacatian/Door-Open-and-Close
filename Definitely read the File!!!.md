# Door-Open-and-Close
Definitely read the README File!!!

In order for this script to work, "DOTween (HOTween v2)" needs to be installed in the project.

For it to work, after the script is thrown to the door object, the "Door_open_and_closed()" function must be called by the object that will control the door(For example, the raycast of the player object).
